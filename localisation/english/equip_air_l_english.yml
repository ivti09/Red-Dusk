 heli_attack:0 "Attack Helicopter"
 heli_attack_equipment:0 "Attack Helicopter"
 heli_attack_equipment_desc:0 "As proven in the conflicts ever since the Second World War, air support can be a deciding factor in ground battles. While attack aircraft can carry a deadly payload, they are unable to forever remain over the battlefield, and are unable to operate effectively without air superiority. Attack helicopters are able to constantly provide support to the division they are attached to, and can remain hidden from enemy aicraft by utilising terrain as cover."
 heli_attack_equipment_0:0 "1970s Attack Helicopter"
 heli_attack_equipment_0_short:0 "Attack Heli I"
 heli_attack_equipment_0_desc:0 "Experiments with existing transport helicopters have proven that these machines can be utilised in ground attack roles, by attaching machine guns, rocket pods, or even missiles to their sides. It is time to develop a dedicated attack helicopter, well-armed and well-armoured against any ground-based threats."
 heli_attack_equipment_1:0 "1990s Attack Helicopter"
 heli_attack_equipment_1_short:0 "Attack Heli II"
 heli_attack_equipment_1_desc:0 "While current attack helicopters are useful against light-armoured ground targets, they pose little threat to armoured divisions, especially ones with ground-based air defense systems. By utilising guided missiles already in use in attack aircraft, attack helicopters can destroy even the most well-armoured targets from afar."
 heli_attack_equipment_2:0 "2010s Attack Helicopter"
 heli_attack_equipment_2_short:0 "Attack Heli III"
 heli_attack_equipment_2_desc:0 "With small portable anti-air missiles now commonly found among infantry, helicopters have become easy targets for enemy ground forces.
