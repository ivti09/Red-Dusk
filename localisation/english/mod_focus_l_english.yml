 USA_aftermath_of_the_uneasy_90s_desc:0 "The 1990s for the United States were a period of confusion, of stagnation, of gridlock, and of inaction; we didn’t exactly fall, but we didn’t rise either. Our nation faced a period of unrest, inability, and most prominently of all, unease. Everything felt like it was on a breaking point, and though Quayle was able to barely sinch the election against Bill Clinton for a second time, it proved to us that, maybe just maybe, we’re not as invincible as we hoped..."
 USA_quayles_america:0 "Quayle's America"
 USA_quayles_america_desc:0 "What’s worse than an unpopular President? A President who’s unpopular because he hasn’t held to a single campaign promise he made, because he hasn’t done anything he said he would, because under him, seemingly nothing has gotten better. Though to the man’s credit, nothing’s gotten inherently worse, but most people aren’t glass half-full types nowadays. With approval ratings as low as 39% by some estimates, Quayle’s Presidency hasn’t done much to try and fix that issue; raising new taxes at the height of the recession, sending troops overseas once more to ensure our position in the Middle East, and generally being a very quiet, almost reserved public official--mostly on account of Quayle’s various, growing health concerns. Just what is he hiding under all those smiles?"
 USA_economic_ramifications:0 "Economic Ramifications"
 USA_economic_ramifications_desc:0 "Ya know, worker’s seemingly do one thing better than all other things: not work apparently. In recent times, the job market has so many openings not only because of the lay-offs from the recession, but because people are outright refusing to work until Quayle can offer them economic stability! We may have raised taxes, but it’s not like there’s a pandemic going on right now locking people in their homes, they can all go back to work whenever they find a new job, and yet here they sit complaining and demanding extra stimulus to get them through the crisis?! Lazy bastards!"
 USA_stagnation_crisis:0 "The "Stagnation Crisis""
 USA_stagnation_crisis_desc:0 "Okay, fine, maybe the crisis is getting bad; recession is one thing, but when the recession turns into stagnation rather than a growth becoming a stagnation, things quickly become a bit of a crisis. All would’ve been fine had we just entered a period of slow-down from a period of growth, but now we’re getting stuck in an era of downturn. When the Stocks began to crawl away from the downturn in ‘98, we had hoped it would be the market kicking back into gear, but unfortunately, things didn’t improve much beyond that slowdown. While things are not actively getting worse, if they don’t start getting better, they might as well be; in response, we’re going to take a page from George H.W. Bush: release the stimuli!"

Ever since 1992, Ross Perot has become a thorn in our sides all the same, though heralding some weird amalgamation of our own values mixed with Democrat economic stances; a sort of Populist jambalaya combining the Welfare State with America-First doctrine, and yet it’s somehow the fastest growing political organization in America! If we’re not careful in the midst of our waning supremacy, we may just see a turn towards a Three-Party Primacy!"

Rather than trying to cement our dominance, discredit the Reformists and strike the Democrats while they’re down, Quayle stumbles and stutters his way through public events, and refuses to take an aggressive stance against our opponents. We’re watching our supremacy wane, and no matter who approaches Quayle about the issue, he just doubles down! He calls it “not ruffling feathers,” even though he neglects the feathers were ruffled long ago, and if he’s not going to act, soon our own party’s feathers will be ruffled right out of Capitol Hill!"
