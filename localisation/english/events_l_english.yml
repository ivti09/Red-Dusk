 ussr_intro.1.d:0 "“It had been less than 10 years from that fateful day, August 19th, 1991. The moment those tanks rolled into Moscow, nobody knew that we would be changing history; nobody understood the gravity of the situation at hand, of the unfolding events that would change the very course of Russia's path. The day that it all went down, and the week that followed, would come to define us; define our glorious Union; define our situation for the foreseeable future. It was the August Coup. Our forces had moved with great haste and swift prejudice--we couldn’t watch as our glorious Motherland died, we simply couldn’t stand by and watch as it all came apart, and so we did as any reasonable men in our situation would do: we took charge of the problem at hand, and we struck it down.”\n\nYanayev was correct in many ways of his assumption of how it had all played out, how the August Coup had been a kind of saving-grace, last hurrah of sorts from the Old Guard of the Communist Party, how it had, at least for now, preserved the status quo of the Soviet Union. While there was no Stalinist revival, the Yanayev regime certainly wasn’t the most amiable with Gorbachev’s open arms towards the insidious influences of the Capitalist, Imperialist West. Yanayev and the Old Guard couldn’t sit idly by and watch as the man of little reservations walked all over the spitting image of Lenin’s great experiment, the project to redeem the proletariat! And so the Coup went through, and for the first time in Russian history, it seemed that, for once, military actions hadn’t progressed or regressed the nation--everything stood still, as if time itself had frozen around the nation. The reforms came to a halt, certainly, but Yanayev knew a moderate hand was necessary to guide the course of the storm and prevent the total breakdown of the country, and seemingly it had worked out... Of course, that was what he had originally thought.\n\nWhen we had committed to the movement, when we had put our support behind the Coup, we knew there would be consequences, some as dire as member states leaving, an economic shock, a political upheaval--but then and now did we know we could deal with it all, one by one, step by step if need be. And yet here we stood, a nation hobbling its way along with one foot in an open grave, a red not so vibrant as the triumphant revolutionary it had once been. Where was Marx's sunrise? Our Glorious Red Star?"

 ussr_intro.2.t:0 "Our Biggest “Failures”"
 ussr_intro.2.d:0 "How could the Monolith that was our glorious, Communist society fail, the greatest, freest, most fair system in the world? Well, as it turns out, throwing a Government Bureaucracy through a Military Coup that replaces the entire strata of said Bureaucracy with new faces primarily based on yes-men and political affluents, there’s a good bit of slowing to be had. When Gorbachev first took office, and when he started implementing his reforms, Yanayev claims to have seen it for what it was--Capitalism with another name, a mock attempt at the abomination created in Beijing by the Dengist regime. And though they were working at least for the time, Yanayev knew that to preserve the Socialist Model he’d have to act quickly to bring it all to a halt. Well, to do that, he had to do a small bit of economic remodeling; some tariffs here, business blocking there, and of course go through with almost returning to a military budget proportional to the Second World War.\n\nYanayev, a Military Man himself, with backing from the Military Industrial Complex, had many faces to appease in the wake of the coup, and to do that would cost him, and more importantly the Moscow treasuries, a large sum to both bolster and rebuff our friends in the Armed Forces; men who demanded larger salaries, men who demanded that we return to an “on-guard” position in the collapse of the Eastern Bloc, men who even began demanding that we kickstart a new phase of the Cold War to try and harness the economy. While the Military Industrial Complex does have its charms, and for several years provided many numerous jobs, we eventually ran out of production necessities: we had all the ammunition, tanks, aircraft we could ever need, even with NATO’s imperialist fingers crawling their way into Eastern Europe, and soon enough, the jobs started to fall through, while the spending kept going: Yanayev knew that once he lost the support of his allies in the military, it was all over, as there would be yet another internal power struggle, now with everyone being armed to the teeth.\n\nThe sudden influx of unemployment into the market was of course offset by the brilliant genius of our Economic Mastery, the Controlled Economy allowing us to assign jobs and duties, but by some work of the West, it hasn’t done much to improve things. We haven’t fallen, per say, but we haven’t progressed either; the economy is in a clear bout of stagnation, a several-year long period of a failure to advance the wellbeing of a population growingly unsettled with the reverting of all of Gorbachev’s work. Now we’re looking down the barrel of both the economy and the military..."

 ussr_intro.3.t:0 "The Elephant(s) in the Room"
 ussr_intro.3.d:0 "With a growingly discontented population, a stagnating economy, fragile political balance, and a worriedly skewed global order, the last thing the Union needed right now was a massive, internalized political struggle over the Chairman’s favor and position.\n\nAnd thus that’s exactly what we’ve been facing since 1991. When you overthrow a popular government via military means, overturn the entire economic direction of the nation, and start meddling with names like “Glasnost” and “Perestroika,” you’re bound to ruffle some feathers, feathers that are attached to vultures and predators alike, men who will gladly tear us apart from the inside to gain power and see out their own sick, twisted vision of our glorious Union.\n\nMen from the military, for instance, hold some of the scariest influence of the lot simply because they hold sway both over the Armed Forces, and more worryingly, over Yanayev himself. The “Militarist Faction,” led by one Marshal Dmitry Yazov, the Militarists’ powers derive from their economic grapple over the Military Industrial Complex, and because they control the very entity that helped Gennady Yanayev take control in the first place--what Yazov says comes with a friendly attached letter that will gladly and openly put into fresh words “or else,” which though not literal haunts the General Secretary day by day. A traditionalist of the Soviet system, Yazov and his gang are not to be underestimated... Not all “Good Soldiers” follow orders.\n\nEven the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet wasn’t safe, with men like Boris Pugo, Secretary of the Interior, working at his own goals to see the USSR rebuilt in an image that was almost mirrored by his former compatriot and the late Secretary, Yuri Andropov; a plan to return to the strongly command economic system, a crackdown on internal dissent and corruption, a strong yet anti-war approach to America and the NATO snakes. While the military holds sway due to its might, Pugo and his cronies exercise their strength by how close they sit to Yanayev. Some keep friends close and enemies closer; when the lines are blurred on who’s who, that becomes a much more risky game of cat and mouse.\n\nLet’s not forget to add on to the pile our good friend, the former Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, who’s still out there--still writing books, still playing hardball even when he’s no longer in Moscow politics. And somehow, he commands respect from the people, OUR people! How does this has-been that we threw out of office nearly ten years ago still somehow bring these people to rise? Well, that may come down to policy, but Yanayev will never admit that giving people greater political and economic autonomy is the driving force there... Gorbachev is still a danger, though, and should never be seen as a nobody. He poses a threat almost as great as the “upstart.”\n\nThat upstart just so happens to originate from the KGB, a young and spry man, head of the organization for that matter. He would happen to be Vladimir-"

 ussr_intro.4.d:0 "Yanayev could not sit on his laurels forever; the Union is facing some of the worst issues it has faced since the Spring of ‘56, and things don’t seem to be improving. With the economy in shambles, the political landscape of the nation on the brink of tossing Russia into yet another mad dash for power, and with the world staring at Moscow waiting for a response, the aging Chairman is starting to feel the weight of not only Russia, but the entire globe, barreling down on his shoulders. He’ll be turning 63 this year, and all of the stress from the coup, from the failing policy, from his inability to act given he had to play nice with so many internal factions, the public outcry, the mounting diplomatic forces, was perhaps too much for his frail shoulders to bear anymore.\n\nHow much longer could little Gennady keep at the game? How much longer could he try in desperation to carry on the mantle of Marx, of Comrades Lenin and Stalin? Frankly, even he didn’t know the answer to that question. He was an old man with enemies on all sides, enemies masquerading as friends, and friends acting like enemies. He was stuck, he was suffering, and with him so too was the Soviet Union stuck and suffering. There would be no quiet recovery, there couldn’t be any way to fix these issues by sitting back and praying for the best--Russia didn’t just need a hero, it needed a Savior, and for the first time in his life, Yanayev was starting to doubt his abilities to carry that title. Could he, could anyone, really save Russia at this point?\n\nWith the factions mounting up for the coming Party Meetings, and with the entire nation sitting on the edges of their seats, waiting in anticipation for an answer from the Kremlin, it would all come down to this. The Chairman’s position was crumbling around him, Russia, though only stagnating now, showed no signs that recovery was on the horizon. We’ve tried our best to keep it all together, but it’s coming to a point where even we don’t know what the future holds for our beloved Union. Another coup? An economic Depression? Or God forbid, a total collapse?\n\nThe Cold War has not simply been a battle of nations, a battle of values, or even a battle of ideologies; it’s been a struggle for the very fate of the Earth, time and time again, where men, for reasons even they do not at times comprehend, will put everything on the line over one, big, red button, a button that could bring about the end of times, the end of mankind itself. These were the horrifying realities we were facing, and for once, we couldn’t hide it under propaganda, under dissidence suppression.\n\nWhere was our Red Star?"

We’ve already lost some member states to secessions in the wake of the coup, we’ve already lost our economy to the flow of stagnation, and seemingly we’ve already lost the will of our people. How can we hope to win? How can we survive?\n\nWe’ll have to figure it out one way or another. We cannot give in, we cannot surrender, we cannot accept defeat laying down! We bear the mantle of Stalin, of all the workers of the world; we beat the Nazis, we beat the Capitalists to the Stars; we beat their God, we beat their will, we’ve beat their way of life, and now all we need is the home push to prove it! Assuredly, it isn’t all propaganda, it isn’t all hopeful dreamings and rantings... Right?\n\nThe United States too has faced her own peril in recent years, surely that’s a sign! The Europeans and their filthy Union have failed to gain major traction in the Eastern Bloc, that’s definitely a sign they wish to return to their friends in Red Square! NATO hasn’t invaded yet, that too is a great success, and we still hold our seats on the United Nations security council, so obviously we’re still a capable and strong nation! Right?... Right?"

Further, the new head of the army is Dimitry Yazov, a feared and capable man that will lead the reformed Soviet Army. The new head of the KGB is a promising young man named Vladimir Putin, and he will be instrumental to the Soviet Union.

The Union's only future is to either reform or vanish. Our over-militarized economy is of no help either. As much as we can show our teeth to the West, if we cannot take care of our people first, it will lead to a disaster. We will have to do some reforming or the Union of the People will not last."

Yanayev, General Secretary of the Soviet Union for the past decade and one of the instigators of the coup that saved the USSR, has resigned. Members of the Politburo were in shock but also very nervous. The moment they were waiting for came, as with Yanayev gone, it is finally their chance to become leaders of the Soviet Union.

Yazov and Pugo, both men in high positions and most influential people in the USSR have been rejected as the leaders! Speaker could barely come to his seance after this event. But in the end the meeting has been prolonged.\n\nThis was an opportunity two very optimistic men in the hall were waiting.\n\nIn the sudden and unexpected move, old reformer Mikhail Gorbachev, tought to have been completely cut from politics, raised from all the members and announced his plan to candidate for the leader of the USSR. It was no surprise to some who knew that the Politburo has rehabilitated him back into politics after he was pronounced to have changed his way and views.\n\nThe second one was Vladimir Putin, current head of the KGB and a promising new rising star of the party. The speaker was informed about his candidacy by a KGB officer present in the hall.  Putin had powerful friends everywhere and was favoured to win.\n\nAnd once again final voting begun and the next leader of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is..."

Putin; who is also the current Chairman of the KGB; and another less relevant one, simply being Putin's adjutant came in. The Colonel  soon made his way in-front of Yazov, and gave him a salute, before, rather coldly saying; \n\n"It is done." \n\nNow, just saying "It is done" would not mean much to many, but knowing his own orders lately, it was rather clear what had happened. Gorbachev was dead. Now, if all went to plan, it would be a murder by some unknown hard-conservative, if not, well, there would not be enough evidence to say whatever either way. Yazov stood up, giving Putin the salute, and simply, gesturing to the door. Sitting back down, Yazov continued working on the documents, but relieved. The enemies, of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet way of life, were meeting their end. And one way, or the other, all would share the fate of Gorbachev.

Our best chance is to invest into the eastern Europe and begin influencing their politics." - One of Gorbachev's economic ministers counter-argued.\n\nGorbachev once again, sat in the middle of this whole ordeal and simply listened. He was unsure.\n\nMaybe generals were right. Swift army offensive could perhaps prevent any and all NATO influences in the east but they can also bring more problems in the long run. We could face more resistance from the small, yet loud minority, just like in the 1989.\n\nOn the other hand, economic and political influence could take time and even just straight up hand over some ex-Warsaw Pact countries to the USA.

 usa.1.t:0 "The State of the Union"
 usa.1.d:0 "With the Soviet Union hobbling its way towards the 21st Century on its last legs, the Cold War had seemed all but over; the Americans watched as the Eastern Bloc ran off in its own, separate direction; watched as the Soviet’s allies began to receive less and less support from Moscow; watched as the dreaded Bear of the East slowly began to enter a permanent hibernation. And yet, for all intents and purposes, for some reason, it didn’t–it was weakened, certainly, but not dead by any means. The Soviet Union would live on, and the American political rings from all sides began to feel the shockwave of this revelation by early 1992. \n\nNo one was quite expecting the chances of Soviet survival; no one on the Left or Right thought it possible for the “Evil Empire” to retain in the world following the Coup, and the American Socialists were just as stunned that the rapidly reformed USSR had just been spun on its head, and as had their directives as political entities. The American nation hadn’t changed much because of it, but the attitude in the air wasn’t so much of “We’ve Won” but more so of “The War’s Still On.” Were the Soviets realistically a threat? Not particularly. Were the American people still on guard? Indeed. Reagan had sown the seeds of what many hoped was an end to the Cold War, and now, it seemed that his labors were just the beginning of the continued fight to put down the Bear. The spirit of the American nation would not be able to allow itself to put down its guard; it couldn’t accept the weakness of the Bear as a reason to finally let down their ethos that the Red Menace need be crushed at all costs. Though, unfortunately for the United States as a whole, not everyone quite agreed that the fight needed to go on, and instead began to wage a new war. \n\nThat fight would begin in the greatest tipping point in American History since the Civil War; a colossal shift in domestic and foreign policy that culminated with the devastatingly small margin, both sides were so close, so edged against one another, that for generations to come, the year 1992 would become the hotspot of a new battle within Washington itself; the Left and Right had come head to head in an internal contest to test the path of America, and to decide the fate of the Cold War, and thus, the fate of the world. And thus, 1992 would become host to..."

 usa.2.t:0 "1992: A Year to Decide"
 usa.2.d:0 "When 1992 came to pass, November Elections were growingly a to-be tense battle for all sides involved; the Republicans under incumbent, 41st President George H.W. Bush had been reeling from a mixed bag of successes–now complicated by an Economic Recession that seemingly only accentuated the President’s reneging on his promises to raise no taxes while in office; the Democrats had stepped forth with Arkansas Governor William “Bill” J. Clinton, a widely popular man of the people who sought to finally put an end to the Cold War’s spending frenzy, and coexist with the dying Soviet Union in a more peaceful world; out of the blue, an up-and-coming Texas Multimillionaire too decided to throw his hat into the Presidential ring, that being Ross Perot and his to-be-declared Reform Party, standing as a strong third option against the Democrats and Republicans for internal change across the board. All three sides had their issues, all three had their strengths, but none of them could rightly predict the outcome of the elections to come–simply by the density of the concern in the air. \n\nBush’s image had certainly been tarnished, but his Cold War efforts seemed all the more necessary as of the rise of the hostile regime under Yanayev’s more traditionally Soviet-style dictatorship out of Moscow; Clinton had the popular face, but nowhere near the credibility, and many were skeptical of the plan to let the Soviets ride peacefully into the sunset just as they began to recover from the initial shock of the August Coup; Ross Perot was a newcomer who challenged both parties with widely demanded issues, but was, indeed, outside of the two party primacy and thus nowhere near guaranteed victory at even the state level. The Republicans were reeling, the Democrats struggling, and Perot’s gang desperately clinging to whatever support they could get, and it all began to culminate together into one of if not the most tense elections of the 20th Century, not just in America, but globally. \n\nThe election was for all intents and purposes up in the air, even up until the night of, and no one quite knew what was going to happen between the popular vote or even the Electoral College–there was even blurring of the lines over how the states would vote. When voting began on November 3rd, results struggled to be tallied until early in the morning on the 4th, when every television, radio, and speaker in America blared out, before crowds of millions in bated breath..."

 usa.3.t:0 "The Outcome of 1992"
 usa.3.d:0 "Against all odds, Bush had by only beaten Clinton by 2 Electoral College votes, marking his victory of 264:262, with Ross Perot having stolen 6 by taking the states of Maine and Alaska: “The Most Contentious Election since 1860” claiming one CNN pundit in the aftermath of the elections. The Democrats as of this time had lost a good bit of their traditional support basin to Perot’s economically social platform and the Republican Party’s avidly Anti-Communist sentiments, both of which resonating in Democrat controlled Southern States, who still voted with far more Socially-Conservative issues in mind, allowing Bush with the far stronger ticket to sweep up several of Clinton’s southern Allies, despite being a Northerner, and was even able to tag a couple dozen delegates out of the Rust Belt with his efforts to continue to back war-based industries following his excursions in Iraq and Kuwait. Recounts, while triggered, failed to give Bill the victory he had desired, but it had revealed something rather appalling to the American people... \n\nBush had failed to win the Popular vote by around a million votes, and yet was able to barely by only two electoral college votes win the Presidency. This was not particularly aided when the Reform party would grab itself a foundation in New England, where Ross Perot, despite being a Southerner in Northern lands, had made a name for himself as the man with a plan; a balance between Republicans and Democrats, and an option that wasn’t too far in either direction. This outcome, overall, put America on a rather unstable path, and the following months were just as tumultuous. \n\nOn January 20th, when Bush was for a second time inaugurated as the United States President, almost half of the Crowd was not there out of support, but a massive protest numbering nearly 50,000 people strong, who would engage in a rather controversial “march” across the city that resulted in the burnings of several American flags, a Police Standoff with Protestors outside of the White House, and nearly five hundred arrests of for Civil Disobedience, Reckless Endangerment, and one for attempting to bludgeon a Police Officer. The Protests lasted all week before city Police alongside members of the National Guard could rein in order, and the seven days of Protest would become the start of a long spiral for America into what would later become known as..."

 usa.4.d:0 "The January Protests would be the first step of many in the descent towards the tension and unease of the ‘90s, a dangerous precedent set that seemed to be the road towards a greater time of unrest... That never really came. Just when everyone thought the American nation was on the brink of massive rioting, the chaos seemingly just stopped out of nowhere. The protesters all left en-masse in droves, the Republican party had refused to openly publicize the event as an attack on the President, and even the Media had quickly attempted to move on from the events. It was as though it had never happened, and yet, the tensions still hanged in the air. \n\nThis era was in no way for the American nation particularly bountiful and prosperous, but at the same time neither was it violent and bloody; while the odd riot or two still broke out in the cities between members of both the Left and Right, the decade itself didn’t follow in the trend of the January Riots. Instead, it followed more the aftermath; no one knew entirely how to feel, and the entire nation entered into a sort of gray zone, an imbalance in the universe itself as the entirety of America sat by for the ride. The tensions around every citizen were palpable, as though one could reach out and grab it, and yet it never came–no great eruption, no horrible collapse. Time simply moved on, and no one could entirely believe it. \n\nPresident Bush would continue to fight on for the next four years of his term in office, watching the Soviet’s every move, building relations in the former Eastern Bloc nations, and even working to oversee the reconstruction of Germany following a period of unrest in the reintegrated East. Bush would use these successes as a cudgel of sorts coming into the 1996 elections, with his popular Vice President Dan Quayle taking up the Republican ballot, and the victory in the end with 282 electoral college votes and 41% of the popular vote; Clinton ran again despite only barely beating out fellow Democrat Lyndon LaRouche at the primaries, and entering into the General elections faced a major blowout with only about 27% of the Popular Vote, and 181 Electoral College votes; Ross Perot on the other hand had advanced his position to taking 32% of the popular vote, securing all of New England, and a large portion of the California voting base. \n\nWith Three parties in the Senate and Congress by the end of the decade, the government had been rather much slowed down; an inability to respond appropriately to many issues, the emergence of Tripartisan politics, and the struggle to find a solution to the Soviet issue had left America in a position of indecisiveness. The Government by 1997 was now feeling the full effect that the nation itself had felt; division that did not tear asunder; a break in the chain and yet the continued march of progress. Time stood still, and yet it still flowed onwards. It was, as the name implied, all in a state of unease..."

The Economic bubble looming on the horizon as well as the jubilance of the New Year had helped to shake off most of the unrest and indecisiveness among the public, but there were still many skeptical voices in the face of what seemed to be the next torch thrown wildly into the darkness of the unknown. \n\nWith the Soviet Union still trudging along, with the Government divided as ever, and with NATO starting to grow more and more fed up with American practices up to this point, all eyes were now turning on to the Land of the Free to get off the ground and start marching. Johnny came marching home from far worse, surely this wouldn’t be the end of the Yanks, and surely they would come out swinging, right? Surely this was the moment when the Star Spangled Banner flew bravely in the air, on land, and sea? Well... No one really knew, least so the Americans.

These were, of course, expected responses, but assuredly some of them would vote to support the bill, right? At least to claim clout for the coming election season, right?\n\nThings began to rapidly deteriorate when several Republican members of the Senate also began to voice distaste for the bill, with one Senator, Ted Stevens of Alaska, claiming that the bill was an open insult to the suffering people of America, and how it would completely overthrow the budget!

 vin_intro.1.d:0 "Vietnam is located in a region considered a cradle of mankind, one of the earliest agricultural centers practicing wet rice farming, where the stone and metallurgical revolutions took place.\n\nIn the early 19th century, Western capitalist countries entered the period of imperialism and colonialism. Through missionaries and trade, the French gradually dominated Vietnam. For the first time in history, Vietnam had to cope with the invasion of a Western industrial country. In that context, some Vietnamese intellectuals were aware of the need to carry out reforms, bringing the country out of stagnation and save national independence. Many reform plans were proposed, yet rejected by the Nguyen Dynasty. Subsequently, the country was driven into backwardness and deadlock and became a semi-feudal colony for nearly 100 years from 1858 to 1945.\n\nThe founding of the Communist Party of Vietnam on 3 February 1930 was an important milestone in the Vietnamese history. In August 1945, under the leadership of the Communist Party headed by President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people successfully launched an uprising to seize power and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam came into being on 2 September 1945.\n\nThe newly founded Vietnam had to go through another 30-year-long struggle for national liberation and reunification. Dien Bien Phu victory and Geneva Accord in 1954 put an end to the war of resistance against the French colonialists. According to the Accord, the country was temporarily separated along the 17th Parallel North into two territories, North Vietnam and the South Vietnam, which were expected to be reunified two years later with a general election. South Vietnam was ruled by a pro-French and then pro-USA government in Saigon. Though Saigon regime attempted to prevent reunification, it failed to subdue peace and national reunification campaigns. As a result, the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam was founded on December 20 1964.\n\nBetween 1954 and 1975, Vietnam had to stand up for national liberation and unification. To support the South Vietnam regime, the US sent military aid and over half a million soldiers to Vietnam, and started bombing North Vietnam in 1964. To fulfill President Ho Chi Minh’s apiration that "nothing is more precious than independence and freedom", the Vietnamese people experienced untold hardship and sacrifice. In 1973, the Paris Accord was signed for restoration of peace in Vietnam and withdrawal of the US troops. The war came to an end in spring 1975 as the patriotic armed forces launched an offensive against the Saigon regime, liberated southern Vietnam and reunified the country. Since then, the unified Vietnam has ushered into a new era of peace, unification and national construction. Democratic Republic of Vietnam was renamed Socialist Republic of Vietnam on April 25 1976."

He couldn't see much but he could hear an intense firefight.\n\nIt probably lasted less than 10 minutes but to him it seemed like an eternity. And then it stopped.

It wasn't even 7 in the morning and the port as well as many city pubs were active, filled with some sailors, off duty soldiers and old folks.\n\nSuch was the morning for two old soldiers, veterans of the Angolan war and most of all, close friends. William and Abdu. Both different in political beliefs, skin colour and status, but bound by comradeship and alcohol. They met each other just like every morning, sat down and ordered their drinks. After greetings were done they moved onto other topics, family stories, memories of serving in the army etc. Until the conversation finally landed onto the topic of politics. It was clear that two were very different in this field.\n\n"I am not sure Abdu. This whole situation we got here is...complex to say the least. But I think that the old bastard Viljoen is the best choice we got. He's not the best but at least we can live normally." - said William.\n\n"Speak for yourself. I am the black one here. Well, at least serving in the army got me a better position in life. But that still doesn't excuse that the apartheid is still here. Hell, maybe Parliament guys have a point, they aren't all that better but maybe they are the only grace to save this country from an open civil war." - Abdu remarked.\n\n"I don't think so, but who gives a damn about our opinions." - William said as he begun drinking his beer.\n\n"You are right. I just hope it will be better, but as long as the pension is on time and I can drink with you, I am happy." - Abdu said before picking his bottle."
 saf.12.a:0 "Aye, I'll drink to that."

 anc.2.d:0 "Besides African natives and population of British origin, South Africa is a home to another group of people - the Boers.\n\nThese men, even tough being colonisers themselves, considering their Dutch origin, have been brave in fighting the South African government over the century. Our politics and opinions on racial issues of South Africa may be different, but one thing unites us - will to fight the British colonisers, or in this case, the South African government.\n\nThis was one of the topics that was talked about on the meeting of ANC's leaders. Many were in favour of seeking Boer support, while others were against it, citing that the Boers themselves were colonisers. Ultimately, the fate of this agreement fell into an unpredictable and quick vote. Will we sacrifice our goal to some extent so that we can secure military support? Or will we stick to it, even tough it will clearly damage our plans of ending this war quickly?\n\nUltimately, the vote was clear:"

 anc.4.d:0 "Banele was sitting on his house porch since the sunrise like he always did. He was a very peaceful and quiet man with no interest in politics or whatever was the main topic in the nation. Not even apartheid touched him since he lived in a more remote area of the country with only contact to the society for him being a trip to a grocery shop.\n\nAs he finally finished his morning rest, he stood up and prepared himself for a 2 kilometer walk to the same town he visited every few days. The sun wasn't at it's peak since it was still early morning and the road was empty as always with only a few military vehicles passing him once. He could hear the soldiers make racist remarks to him but he wasn't bothered. He had only one task and he was going to do it.\n\nAs he made his way to the town outskirts an explosion destroyed a a military convoy that was park in the town square. Banele took cover in a nearest ditch, he covered his ears and hoped that this whole ordeal would pass as fast as possible.\n\nAfter peaking his head out of the ditch after a few minutes, he could clearly see that some buildings were engulfed in flames, but there were no soldiers present. Silence fell onto the town as if nothing had even happened. He got out of the ditch and made his way to the town square where he could clearly see dead soldiers on the ground and a group of what seemed like a mixed militia force gathering guns. It seemed like a whole international gathering of various races, political and religious groups in one squad.\n\nAfter he approached the men, one of them spoke to him:\n\n"Don't worry brother, this town is safe now. This town is free of apartheid."\n\nBanele, standing with a confused but somewhat happy look on his face said:"

Besides him was his squad full of various people, from Africans, a few Boers, communists and other people who have been oppressed by the South African regime for so long. He himself was an English born socialist who wanted to fight for a right thing in his life and finally fulfil what he taught was his destiny.\n\nAs he sat there thinking of everything that that happened to him for the past few days, his squad member Ndlovu, an African corporal broke the silence:\n\n"Jhonas, I want to ask you something."\n\nCut off from his thinking, Jhonas turned to him and said: "Yes Ndlovu? What did you want to ask?"\n\n"What are you going to do after all this is over? You know, after we win." - Ndlovu asked.\n\n"What I would-" - Jhonas stopped for a second to think before finally answering: "To be honest, I don't really know. Probably go back to my studies and finally get that diploma for political sciences. What about you?"\n\n"Me? I would like to perhaps become a baker in the Cape. Even Lesedi said that she would like to help me with it." - Ndlovu answered him.\n\nAll of the sudden an explosion rang out across the base and almost all hell broke loose. In that moment Jhonas gave and order to the squad to move into the combat but for a second he turned to Ndlovu and told him:"
